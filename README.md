# Universal Cyber Incident Taxonomy (UCIT)

The Universal Cyber Incident Taxonomy (UCIT) is a practical, open-source framework for labeling and classifying cyber incidents based on MITRE ATT&CK. It‚Äôs designed to provide clear, consistent short-form naming for security events‚Äîusable in real-time during detection and response, and structured enough to support long-term analysis and reporting.

Most existing frameworks (like those from CISA, DoD, or Verizon) suffer from vague categories, ambiguous overlap, or a lack of behavioral depth. UCIT was built from the ground up to fix that.

## üîç What Is UCIT?

UCIT uses a **trinomial naming convention** to describe incidents as objects:

(High-Level Category) ‚Äì (Behavioral Technique) ‚Äì (Compromise Level)


Each label reflects:

- **What kind of incident it is** (e.g., System Intrusion, Boundary Activity)
- **What the adversary was doing** (e.g., Credential Access, Discovery)
- **How much access they had** (User, Root, or Unknown)

It can be used during triage or investigation and is extended post-incident using a closeout **Final Observed Technique** field for complete granularity.

---

## üß† Why Use UCIT?

- Clear, structured incident labeling in plain English
- Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework (tactic-level only)
- Designed for point-in-time triage and long-term metrics
- Flexible enough to be integrated into SIEMs, SOARs, or manual IR workflows
- Already tested against [100 realistic incident scenarios](docs/100-scenarios.csv)

---

## üîß How It Works

An example UCIT label:

System Intrusion ‚Äì Credential Access ‚Äì User

This tells you:
- The activity was **inside the environment**
- The behavior involved **stealing credentials**
- The adversary had **user-level access**

Once the investigation concludes, you can append a final technique:

Final Observed Technique: Exfiltration
